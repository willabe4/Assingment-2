                    <p>Loaders are the mainstay of Hyperion's military might on Pandora. They come in an array of different varieties, each variant suited to a particular role when in action. Completely without conscience, they are the military and the enforcers. Loaders supplement and make up the bulk of Hyperion's forces, but not the entirety of them, as human soldiers and support units also work alongside them. Loaders are highly versatile, serving a variety of roles ranging from basic infantry, to snipers, to air forces.</p> 
                    <p>Our in-combat production of Loaders comes from our impressive Constructor bots. Constructor bots are large, tripedal Hyperion mobile robot factories. They can digistruct Hyperion loaders as well as assult enemy troops with autocannons.</p>

                <div class="weapondscrp">
                    <p>Hyperion says: afterlife, schmafterlife. New-U Stations are antenna-like terminals scattered throughout the univserse, primarily located at outposts and major towns and cities. The New-U Station serves a vital function. It stores your DNA against the possibility of "accidental death or dismemberment" and can digistruct an entirely new body to replace the recently deceased one.The fee for respawning at a New-U station costs 7% of your total wealth, although we believe you can't put a price on precious life.</p>

                <p>Helios is the Hyperion corporation's base of operations near Pandora. Perhaps the corwn jewel of Hyperion technology, Helios is capable of launching orbital assaults known as moonshot blitzes which are capable of devastating the target areas, and can also send a ground assault almost anywhere by launching loaders and constructors. Its most powerful weapon is "The Eye of Helios", a massive laser consisting of multiple smaller lasers to destroy almost any landscape where it is fired at. It is powered by the eye of The Destroyer, the creature that was released and killed during the opening of the original Vault.</p>
                <p> The moonbase manages to stay in a perfect luna- and geostationary orbit between Pandora and Elpis, allowing it to keep its eye trained on Hyperion operations at all times.</p>
